<br>
<div id="Lists">
<h3> 1. Make A Culture club in you school or community!!</h3>
<p> This can allow for the youth to express what experiences they have undergone.</p>
<br>
<h3> 2. Hold Conversations With People You may Not Know A Lot About.</h3>
<p> Speaking with others can help you and others become more culturally aware.</p>
<br>
<h3> 3. Encourage Diversity in groups and public places.</h3>
<p> Thinking About the different types of people in a setting can build a comprehension of cultual differences and how to work through them.</p>
<br>
<h3> 4. Stand By Those who face discrimination.</h3>
<p> Advocating for those who face discrimination not only shows others that you are an ally but can make them feel more comfortable sharing their stories and culture with others.
